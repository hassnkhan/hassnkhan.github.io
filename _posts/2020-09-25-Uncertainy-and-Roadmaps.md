We have all spent the better part of this summer obsessing over the shape and direction of infection curves. If there’s anything we’ve learned from our collective crash-course in epidemiology, it’s that the exercise of forecasting the future is quite hard. The models we’re building aren’t imbued with foresight no matter how complex (or, uh, simple) their underlying dynamics.

I will return to a more general discussion of forecasting and how institutional pressures influence the exercise at the end of this piece. I will first examine in more detail perhaps the most famous of contemporary forecasts: Moore’s Law. The simplified story is that we went from building-sized mainframes with lilliputian capabilities to carrying supercomputers in our pockets and it was made possible principally by the ongoing improvement in silicon transistors  (first BJTs, later MOS and finally CMOS) which enabled exponential increases in integration, a trend foreseen most elegantly by Gordon Moore in his publication in 1965. The myth of Moore’s Law underpins significant commentary about the technological possibilities of our future.

I’d like to explore in more detail the history of Moore’s own forecasts and then comment on the institutional context in which it was extended and refreshed. Given the importance of semiconductor technology to the last 40 years of technological progress, there is an already deep scholarship on the subject matter, which I’ll borrow from readily, but my intent is to explore not just how projections are shaped by and shape our actions but also how “wrongness” can be corrected and what that says about the nature of technology.

It’s worth beginning with some context for Moore’s original projection [^1]. With the benefit of hindsight the dominance of the integrated circuit is a natural evolution of transistor technology. However, the future of computing technology was far less certain in the early 1960s. Although transistor technology was evolving rapidly[^2: good reads], numerous groups hadA slew of technologies had emerged in the early 60s with different backers. The  including microcircuits, the monolithic integrated circuit, XX and the preposterously named “molecular electronics.” The different research divisions of the armed forces had also backed

The best way to understand Moore’s 1965 piece is as an advertisement about the possibilities of integrated circuits. The readership of Electronics would likely include executives, technologists, and government officials who were trying to understand which technologies to bet on in future projects.  

At around the same time, you had influential corporate researchers like Morton from Bell Labs saying the electronics industry needed to return to the well of science.

So, for an electronics systems executive or defense contractor you were faced with the question of “what should I build with?”

In 1965, Gordon Moore was not alone in predicting a bright future for the integrated circuit. An IEEE Spectrum conference for the year before featured several prominent executives all arguing that integrated circuit production techniques would offer advantages over discrete transistors in both yield and price. 

Harry Knowles, a manager from the infamous “Molecular Electronics Division,” at Westinghouse wrote the following (emphasis mine),

> During 1964, a saturated logic time in the 10- nanosecond range will probably be achieved—and per­haps even a lower value. **Speed has doubled every year over the past seven years on the average. Greater speeds depend upon mechanical tolerances. If transistors, diodes, resistors, etc., can be made smaller, the use of smaller parasitic capacitances implied thereby means that the speed of the circuits will be increased.**   
> …  
> **Masking tolerances are now in the 7- to 8-micron range, with a 15-ns saturated logic. We can soon expect 3- to 4-micron tolerances and 5- to 7-ns saturated logic. Electron-beam sensing and machining will permit 0.1- micron tolerances and subnanosecond logic speeds.**   
> Parenthetically, it is interesting to extrapolate on what a one-inch silicon slice would produce if the size of in­dividual components were decreased by a factor of 15. Figure 22 shows an integrated circuit which may be fabricated on a silicon wafer at a density of about 800 gates per square inch, using 8-micron tolerances. **If these tolerances were reduced to 0.5 micron, the area of the circuits would be reduced by slightly over 200. The number of circuits per square inch would then be about 16 000. In addition, the gates would operate 15 times faster or in the 1-ns delay range. Such a wafer would have a logic power about 100 times greater than today’s largest computer!**   

Knowles also included a graph that plotted the cost of an integrated circuit as a function of complexity. Keep this one in mind.

The first iteration of Moore’s Law would come the next year in Electronics Magazine. Moore drew a similar set of curves
